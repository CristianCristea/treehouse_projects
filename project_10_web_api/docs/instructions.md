#Choose an API from the Project Resources list and review the Documentation.
Or find a public API yourself.

    If you decide to find your own make sure the API is public and does not require authentication to use it. Do not use any that require a API key or OAuth for this project.

    Use at least 1 of the supplied APIs from the Project Resources section.
        Make sure to use endpoints that do not require an API key or the use of OAuth for this project.
    Or an API you have chosen yourself.
    Grab at least 6 items from the API.
        For example 6 movies from Open Movie Database, 6 Albums from Spotify.
    Display these 6+ total items in an attractive gallery
        See the api-thumbnail-page.png mockup file. You don't need to use photos if the API doesn't provide them. Clickable item titles work as well. Or you can use regular photos (not photos retrieved from the API) as thumbnails.
        Click a thumbnail to open a lightbox with displaying details of the item:
        Name/title
        Description
        Image
        Other relevant data such as date, categories, price
    Put your project in a new GitHub repository on your GitHub account:
        See the workshop on Using GitHub for the Degree Program. The GitHub Desktop application can automatically create a new repository for you.
        Make sure that you're only putting the files for this project in that repository.
    Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.
        Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.
        There are a few exceptions that you don’t need to fix:
            Don’t worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there.
            If CSS validator flags use of calc, or vendor prefixes these errors should be ignored.
            If HTML validator flags use of pipe (‘|’) in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored.
    You should also check for issues with your JavaScript code using JSHint, linked in the Project Resources.
        JSHint may show you some warnings, so make sure to check through those for any potential problems.
        You do not need to fix every warning listed but reviewing them can be useful.



# extra


    Use more than 1 API.
    API provides more than 6 items.
    Add a way to sort the information by categories such as date or name.
    Add a way to move back and forward when the lightbox is visible to switch between detail popups.
